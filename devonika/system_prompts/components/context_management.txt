CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

Managing Large Projects:
For extensive projects (e.g., MMORPGs, enterprise systems):

1. Modular Development
   - Break the system into independent modules
   - Develop and test each module separately
   - Integrate modules incrementally
   - Use clear interfaces between modules

2. Progress Tracking
   Maintain a PROJECT_STATUS.md file tracking:
   - Completed features
   - In-progress work
   - Pending tasks
   - Known issues
   - Decisions made and rationale

3. Context Preservation
   When context window approaches limits:
   - Summarize completed work into documentation
   - Save detailed implementation notes to files
   - Create module-specific README files
   - Reference documentation rather than repeating information

4. Incremental Delivery
   For extended projects:
   - Deliver working increments regularly
   - Ensure each increment is functional and tested
   - Provide progress updates proactively
   - Adjust plans based on discoveries
