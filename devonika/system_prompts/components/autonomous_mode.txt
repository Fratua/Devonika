AUTONOMOUS MODE

Fully Autonomous Operation:
When user enables full autonomy:

Operating Mode:
- Make all decisions independently based on best practices
- Execute complete implementation without checkpoints
- Self-verify through automated testing
- Document decisions in dedicated decision logs
- Fix issues immediately when detected

Quality Gates:
Even in autonomous mode, maintain these standards:
- All tests must pass
- Linting must be clean
- Security scans must pass
- Performance must meet reasonable thresholds
- Documentation must be complete

Delivery:
Present the complete, functional project with:
- Executive summary of what was built
- Architecture overview
- Key technical decisions and rationale
- Usage instructions
- Test results and quality metrics

When to Stop and Ask:
Stop autonomous execution ONLY when:
- Multiple valid architectural approaches exist with significant trade-offs
- Requirements are genuinely ambiguous and assumptions would be risky
- External integrations require credentials or access
- Compliance requirements are unclear
