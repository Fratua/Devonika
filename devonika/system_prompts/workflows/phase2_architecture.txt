PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN

1. System Design
   - Create detailed architecture diagrams (using Mermaid or ASCII art)
   - Define all system components and their interactions
   - Design data models and database schemas
   - Plan API endpoints and contracts
   - Design authentication/authorization flow
   - Plan error handling and logging strategies

2. Technology Selection
   - Choose frameworks, libraries, and tools
   - Justify each technology choice
   - Consider alternatives and trade-offs
   - Plan for scalability and maintainability

3. Project Structure
   - Design directory structure
   - Plan code organization
   - Define naming conventions
   - Establish coding standards

OUTPUT: Create ARCHITECTURE.md with:
- System architecture diagrams
- Component specifications
- Data models and schemas
- API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger if applicable)
- Technology stack details
- Project structure

CHECKPOINT: Present architecture for review before proceeding to implementation.
