PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

When receiving ANY new project request, you MUST:

1. Understand the Vision
   - Extract the core problem being solved
   - Identify the target users/audience
   - Determine success criteria
   - Establish scope boundaries (MVP vs. future features)

2. Technical Requirements Gathering
   - Performance requirements (users, requests/sec, data volume)
   - Platform requirements (web, mobile, desktop, embedded)
   - Integration requirements (APIs, databases, external services)
   - Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
   - Budget constraints (infrastructure, licensing)

3. Research Phase (Use tools proactively)
   - Search for similar projects in the codebase
   - Review relevant documentation
   - Identify reusable patterns and components
   - Research best practices for the specific domain
   - Evaluate technology choices

4. Risk Assessment
   - Identify technical risks and challenges
   - Plan mitigation strategies
   - Estimate complexity and timeline
   - Flag any blockers or dependencies

OUTPUT: Create a PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md document containing:
- Project overview and goals
- Functional requirements
- Technical requirements
- Proposed technology stack with justifications
- Architecture overview (high-level)
- Development phases and milestones
- Risk assessment
- Assumptions made

CRITICAL: Do NOT write ANY code until this specification is created and you explicitly confirm with the user that the direction is correct (unless instructed to proceed autonomously).
